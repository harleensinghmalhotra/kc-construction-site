Here are the top 5 signs it's time to call a general contractor in Chicago.</p><h2>1. Foundation Cracks or Settling</h2><p>Chicago's freeze-thaw cycle is brutal on foundations. Diagonal cracks in walls, sticking doors, or uneven floors are red flags. Our <a href='/services#general'>general construction team</a> can assess and remediate foundation issues before they become catastrophic.</p><h2>2. Outdated Electrical or Plumbing</h2><p>Homes in <strong>Chicago's historic neighborhoods</strong> like Pilsen, Bridgeport, or Beverly often have knob-and-tube wiring or galvanized pipes. These aren't just inconvenient—they're safety hazards that require immediate attention.</p><h2>3. Water Damage or Persistent Moisture</h2><p>Basement flooding is common in Chicago. Stained ceilings, warped drywall, and mold growth signal moisture intrusion. Our <a href='/services#drywall'>drywall and interior services</a> address the symptoms while we fix the source.</p><h2>4. Energy Inefficiency</h2><p>If your energy bills keep climbing despite Chicago's energy efficiency programs, your insulation, windows, or HVAC system may be failing. A renovation is often more cost-effective than continued patching.</p><h2>5. Your Home No Longer Fits Your Life</h2><p>Growing families in <strong>Oak Park</strong>, <strong>Evanston</strong>, or the <strong>Chicago suburbs</strong> often need more space. Rather than moving, many homeowners choose to renovate—adding bedrooms, expanding kitchens, or converting basements.</p><p>Ready to renovate? <a href='/contact'>Contact King Coleman Construction</a> for a free consultation. We serve all of Chicago, <strong>Evanston</strong>, <strong>Oak Park</strong>, <strong>Naperville</strong>, and beyond.</p>"
